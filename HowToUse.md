How To Use & Features for the Future
=========================== 

## Current Use Case

Users will be presented with the Baltimore Map. The map will display three types or road hazards - accidents, arrests, and hazards - as dots. The map will also show a small sample of bike paths. The color of a bike path will indicate the type of road hazard that is present on the path. 

Road hazard types included are: potholes, accidents, streets wtih high traffic, lights out, signs missing, trees down, etc.

## How To Use It

- Zoom into the area where you plan to ride a bike. 
- Check your planned route. 
- Reconsider if your route all appear red.
- Ride along the path that has more green than red!

## Future Features To Add

- All bike paths wil be mapped.
- The dots will be smoothed out into the surface of the map, so that the entire map would show the range of the colors from green to red, which indicates the safety of the areas for bicycling. 
- Allow users to enter the starting point and the destinattion.
- The application then displays the bike path that is the safest.
- Allow users to pick the type of road hazards, which they are most concerend about. The applicaiton will display the bike path that has the least number of the specific type of the road hazard the user has chosen.
