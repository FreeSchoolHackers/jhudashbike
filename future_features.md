Features for the Future
=========================== 

## Current Use Case

Users will be presented with the Baltimore Map. The map will display the bike path. The regions near the bike path will be colored depending on how many road hazard indicators are present close to the bike path. Hazadous paths will appear as red. Safe paths will appear as green. 

Road hazard types included are: potholes, accidents, streets wtih high traffic, lights out, signs missing, trees down, etc.

## How To Use It

- Zoom into the area where you plan to ride a bike. 
- Check your planned route. 
- Reconsider if your route all appear red.
- Ride along the path that has more green than red!
